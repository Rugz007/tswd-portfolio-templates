# About me
Hi, I am a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University and I love computer programming and everything around it in general.

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. How to make better graphs and choose which graph to use for a specific use case.
2. Give better feedback on existing graphs which ensures that the new graph will be much better. 
3. How do existing tools incorporate these good practices and why do we still end up with bad graphs today?


## Assignment: [Visualizing government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)

## Final project

My final project will be a pitch for a mock startup that aims to solve the problem of technical debt in the software industry. The startup is called Johnathan AI and it is an AI tool that reviews code and identifies technical debt. The tool will also provide developers with suggestions to fix the technical debt. The story will be a pitch for the startup.
