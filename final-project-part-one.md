# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Majority of the developers are on stackoverflow and they are the best source to get the data from. The survey is done by stackoverflow and they have a lot of data about the developers. I am planning to use this data to get the statistics about the mental health and satisfaction in the software industry. 

I am also planning to use the guide from softwaredegrees.org to get a few statistics about mental health in the tech industry.

I am using layoffs.fyi to get the data about the tech companies laying people off. I will be using this data to show the impact of layoffs on the mental health of the developers.

Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project. 
I am going to use Tableau and other public charting tools like rawgraphs.io to create the charts and use shorthand to create the story.
