# Outline
The project topic I have chosen is to talk about Mental health and satisfaction in the software industry. As long as I remember, I have been in the software industry for quite a while and there seems to a sense of unhappiness recently in the software developer industry. I want to explore that. 

1. Introduction
    - Introduce the topic of mental health and satisfaction in the software industry
    - Introduce the data sources
    - Introduce the user stories
2. Why do people chose software industry
    - Money: Insanely high salaries
    - Flexibility: Work from home, flexible hours
3. Talk about the decline of mental health in the software industry
    - Stress: High stress levels
    - Burnout: Burnout is common
    - Long hours: Long working hours
    - Layoffs: Layoffs are common
4. Talk about the decline of satisfaction in the software industry
5. Is software engineering/coding the problem?
6. Factors that contribute to job satisfaction
    - Admired vs desired skills
    - Influence
    - Other things
7. Conclusion
    - Summarize the findings
    - Provide recommendations

## Initial sketches

This is my story emotion graph

Salaries by professions

I am planning to include callouts about these statistics
- 51% had been diagnosed with a mental health condition.
- 57% reported burnout.
- 71% said a mental health issue reduced their productivity.

Some data about layoffs like `137,460 / 1365500 * 100 = 10%` of people in the SDE industry in the US got laid off just in the year 2024.

Satisfaction in jobs

I am going to then transition and ask the question is coding as a profession the issue?

No because a lot of people seem to be doing it (60%ish) even as a hobby outside work

So let's talk what is fun to use at work so you'd be happy as an engineer

But do you get to choose what technologies to use?

And a few other factors which contribute to job satisfaction

And last thing,

Recommendations are a part I am still thinking how to incorporate as a good conclusion but initial ideas include - Exercise!

Sitting more than 8 hours a day can increase the risk of premature death by up to 60% - Cambridge Universityâ€™s studies


The number of poor mental health days dropped by more than 40 percent - The Lancelet study


# The data

Majority of the developers are on stackoverflow and they are the best source to get the data from. The survey is done by stackoverflow and they have a lot of data about the developers. I am planning to use this data to get the statistics about the mental health and satisfaction in the software industry. 

I am also planning to use the guide from softwaredegrees.org to get a few statistics about mental health in the tech industry.

I am using layoffs.fyi to get the data about the tech companies laying people off. I will be using this data to show the impact of layoffs on the mental health of the developers.

# Method and medium
I am going to use Tableau and other public charting tools like rawgraphs.io to create the charts and use shorthand to create the story.
