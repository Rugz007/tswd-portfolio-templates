# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
After talking to software engineers about the story I presented, they addressed these following concerns:
1. The pitch did not address the cost savings that the tool would bring to the company. Usually, the cost savings are a big factor in the decision-making process and hence should be included in the pitch.
2. The pitch did not address the potential concerns that the software engineers might have. For example, the tool might not be able to identify all the technical debt in the code. This could lead to a false sense of security and hence the developers might not be as vigilant in their code reviews.
3. There was no inclusion of how the tool could be seemlessly integrated into the existing workflow of the developers. This is important as the developers are already used to a certain workflow and any changes to that might be met with resistance.

The way I addressed these problems were as follows:
1. The story now includes a section on how much estimated cost the tool would save the company, where the calculations for the said savings was listed in the subtitle for transparency.
2. The story also addresses the potential concerns that the software engineers might have. This section includes the limitations of the tool and how the developers can work around them.
3. The story has a section for 'mockup' tools the product can integrate with.

## The audience


My audience for the final data story were potential investors and software developers who are looking for a solution to the technical debt problem. The story is a pitch for the startup. 

An aha-moment for me while finishing up the final deliverable was the audience is more towards CTOs of tech companies than potential investors and hence I adjusted the story to reflect that. The CTOs are the ones who would be making the decision to invest in the tool and hence the story should be tailored to them. I included things like how much money the tool would save and how the tool could be integrated into the existing workflow of the developers.

This helped me narrow down the focus of the story, talk about the things I feel comfortable talking about and also address the concerns that the intended audience might have. I have explained in the further sections how the audience influenced the changes I made to the story and how the audience itself changed over the course of the project.

## Final design decisions

1. One of the major design decisions I made initially was structuring the story into two parts; first, focusiog on the satisfaction problem in the software industry and second, introducing the solution through Johnathan AI. This decision allowed for a logical flow where I first build up the context of the problem and then lead into the solution. I learned that this approach helps engage the audience by first appealing to their emotions with the problem before pitching the product as a solution.

2. I decided to included very simple graphs for this story because of the time constraint a person has while reading the story and the time constraint I had presenting it. I wanted to make sure that the audience could understand the graphs in a glance and hence I included very simple graphs with minimal data points. I also included a lot of callouts to highlight the important statistics in the story.

3. For the second part, I had to adjust the tone when targeting potential investors in the pitch for Johnathan AI. This involved shifting from a broad discussion on mental health to a more solution-driven tone, which was more focused on how the AI can solve technical debt issues. I realized that keeping the target audience in mind was key to deciding how the data should be framed.

4. Throughout the design process, I encountered concerns such as privacy issues, potential IP theft, and hallucination (false positives) in AI-generated code reviews. These were highlighted in the user interviews and shaped my decision to include clear explanations in the story about how Johnathan AI would mitigate these risks. I also learned that addressing potential concerns upfront helps build trust with both users and investors.

5. My audience changed once more after the user interviews. I realized that the story was more tailored towards CTOs of tech companies than potential investors. This could be because my user interiews
had all been with software engineers and hence the story was more tailored towards them. So now that I write this reflection, I realize I became a bit more biased towards pitching the product to the software engineers than the investors. The fact that the audience I talked to changed the intention of the story is a big learning for me and I will keep that in mind for future projects.

# Final thoughts
Overall, this project was both challenging and rewarding. It gave me an opportunity to deeply explore the issue of mental health and job satisfaction in the software industry, a topic I’ve been curious about for a while. I was most excited about the user research aspect, as it provided real-world validation for the problem and helped shape the solution in ways I hadn’t initially considered. It was rewarding to see how the interviews helped refine the pitch for Johnathan AI.


I also found myself constrained by time when it came to fully fleshing out the technical debt section of the story. While I touched on it enough to highlight the problem, I would have liked to dive deeper into how Johnathan AI specifically mitigates various types of technical debt.
